# What the web-app does?

It lets u take a quiz and gives you the result.
You can also create account and safe your user information.

# Modified Requirements

We did google authentication and hence we don't require the user to enter their username and password, rather we directly connect them
to google sign up. This means we don't have access to let them edit their password and email, therefore we have modified the profile
edit page where the user can only edit their user name but not password and email. The user needs to directly modify their google account inorder to edit those information.
